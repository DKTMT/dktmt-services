def triangular_moving_average(market_data, tma_period: int = 20, buy_threshold: float = 0, sell_threshold: float = 0) -> str:
    """
    Computes the triangular moving average (TMA) of the given market data and generates a buy, sell, or hold signal based on
    the difference between the TMA and the current price. The buy and sell thresholds can be customized to generate signals
    with different sensitivities.
    Args:
    - market_data: A list of lists, where each inner list represents the data for a single day in the format [date, open, high, low, close, volume].
    - tma_period: An integer representing the number of days to include in the TMA calculation. Default value is 20.
    - buy_threshold: A float representing the minimum TMA difference required to generate a buy signal. Default value is 0.
    - sell_threshold: A float representing the maximum TMA difference required to generate a sell signal. Default value is 0.

    Returns:
    - A string representing the signal generated based on the TMA difference. Possible values are 'buy', 'sell', or 'hold'.
